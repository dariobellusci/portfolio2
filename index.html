            <p class="text"> Hi, I'm Dario Bellusci. Welcome to my website.
            I’m currently living in Milan. I would like to apply, as in your course master.
            I have a solid educational foundation and passion for design especially in typography, 
            I graduated at “Libera Accademia di Belle Arti” in Brescia. During these three years I developed ability to work in team and I learned how to meet deadlines and work professionally and under pressure.
            My work experience includes corporate, editorials, agency and freelance graphic design, I worked in two advertising agencies 
            in Bergamo while I was studying for my bachelor’s degree, then, since I was more interested in the creative area, 
            I started an internship in a graphic design studio in Brescia (Studio Frames) where I had the chance to experimented with 
            projects for museums and editorials. Now I’m working as freelance taking care of corporate image, editorial projects, logos and websites.
            I have an expert knowledge of Adobe Creative Suite and WordPress. I enjoy collaborating with clients and with creative teams.
            I’m precise and rigorous and I always follow the layout’s rules. Before start a new project I always research and try to understand 
            and learn from masters of graphic and my mains inspirations are Bob Noorda and Massimo Vignelli.
            I grew up in a family of printers and photographers that passed on me a passion for this job.I enjoy being challenged and engaging 
            with projects that require me to work outside my comfort and knowledge set because this allows me to learn new languages and new 
            techniques. I’m energetic and strongly passionate in what I do, I always try to improve myself in each project.
            <br>
            <br>
            Regards, <i>Dario.</i>

                I don't know what I’m going to do in three years. 
                My goal is to open my own graphic design studio, 
                which wouldn’t only provide projects, but that would be 
                a means of dialogue with the reality we all will be living in, a 
                way of approaching new worlds and/or fields.

        <p class="text">
            Communication is part of our daily life on paper, on the streets  and on the web.
            Words and images are part of our way of reading and understanding the world as it is. 
            As this generation is getting more and more into a digital one, I believe that, for my 
            personal growth, it is important to make it an object of study, in order to be able to 
            combine two professions: the designer and the developer.
            <br> I chose to apply for this talent garden master because I’ve got the feeling 
            that it’s an energetic reality that allows you to have a full immersion in studying 
            and then practicing in well-structured companies.
            <br>
            <br>
            What do I expect from this class?
            <br>
            <br>
            <i>- Study a new profession</i>
            <br>
            <i>- Learn to beget codes</i>
            <br>
            <i>- Be ready for a future job</i>
